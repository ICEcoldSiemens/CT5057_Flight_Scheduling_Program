# CT5057_Flight_Scheduling_Program
A flight scheduling program that enables customers to book and schedule flights, utilizing a variety of data structures.. Assigned to grasp the design and functionality of fundamental searching, sorting, and traversing algorithms.

Each flight has the following properties:
- A flight number (integer 0- 999)
- A departure airport
- A departure date
- An arrival airport
- A seating list <br></br>

Each seating list has the following properties:
- The number and range of first class seats (i.e. 5 seats, seats 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).
- The number and range of business class seats (i.e. 10 seats, seats 6 - 15)
- The number and range of economy class seats (i.e. 20 seats, seats 16 - 35) <br></br>


A particular class can have an arbitrary range of seats (i.e. first class, 5 seats, seats 1, 5, 9, 11, 21). Once the list of flights is given, you are ready to start scheduling passengers.

Schedule a passenger for a flight: Choose a flight number. Choose a class. If all the seats are full, give the option to put the passenger on a wait list. There should be a wait list for every class (first, business, and economy).

Cancel a passenger from a flight: Choose a passenger. Choose a flight. If there are passengers on the wait list, print the name of the next passenger and give the option to schedule that passenger for the available seat.

Passenger status: print the status of a passenger; Choose a passenger. If the passenger is scheduled for a flight, print the flight information. If the passenger is on a wait list, print the flight information and the passenger's position on the wait list.

Flight information: print the information for a flight; Print the departure airport, the departure date, the arrival airport, and a list of all the seats and the name of the passenger in each seat.<br></br>


# Algorithm and Data Structures
There are many ways to implement this program, many different data structures and algorithms can be used, and many ways the project description can be extended and be more realistic. However, you are required to use:

·       at least one of the data structures (queues/graphs/trees) proposed in lectures;

·       at least one of the sorting algorithms studied during the lectures;

·       at least one of the searching algorithms studied during the lectures; <br></br>
